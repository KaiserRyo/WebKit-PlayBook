<h1>Two Audios</h1>
<p>This file exists to test the interaction between two audio players.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Start one of the media players:
verify that you can pause and restart it multiple times.
</li>
<li>
Let it play to the end:
verify that you can restart it.
</li>
<li>
Start the second player while the first is already playing:
verify that the second player starts and that the first is stopped automatically.
</li>
<li>
Restart the first, then restart the second, then restart the first, etc., in quick succession
(i.e. with less than a second between them):
verify that the next player restarts when told to, and that the currently-playing player always
stops (so that there's never a time when both players are playing simultaneously).
</li>
</ul>
